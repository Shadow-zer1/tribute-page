        Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan was a renowned Pakistani nuclear physicist and
        metallurgical engineer. He is widely recognized as the father of
        Pakistan’s nuclear program. Born in 1936, he led the country’s efforts
        to develop nuclear weapons, helping Pakistan become the first Islamic
        nation with nuclear capability in 1998.
        <br /><br />
        His work in uranium enrichment, scientific leadership, and national
        service earned him immense respect. Despite controversies later in life,
        he remains a national hero and a symbol of technological progress and
        strength in Pakistan.
